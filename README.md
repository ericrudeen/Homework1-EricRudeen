# Homework1-EricRudeen Code Refractor Assignment

## Description

This assignment was to refractor a marketing agency's website to be completely accessible. The most important steps taken to make this website accessible was to add titles and alt tags to all of the images so that users with unique needs could effectively engage with the website using website readers or otherwise. 

It was also important to make sure that the html and css was organized in a semantic and logical manner. A lot of the work on this was done to the css stylesheet. I had to move around many of the selectors and properties around to be grouped semantically and logically. 

Though teh aforementioned were the two most important steps taken to make this site accessible, there were also some other things that needed to be done such as adding descriptive titles and ensuring heading tags with in a sequential order.
